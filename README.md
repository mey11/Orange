# Orange
A project for my Software Craftsmanship class that keeps tracks of the exchanges, returns, etc. of various "Orange" products.

This project was intended to better develop good coding habits through concepts like:
  clear and explanatory naming conventions,
  abstraction (e.g. the AbstractProduct class),
  creating objects through using the Factory Method (e.g. the make() method in the AbstractProduct class),
  private constructors coupled with build() methods (e.g. in the Return and Exchange classes),
  error handling through validation methods (e.g. in all the Product classes), etc.
  
Though this project is completed, I will continue to improve upon it based on the ongoing class discussion (for example, when studying testing more in-depth).
